                    You have been invited to take part in a research study: Search-and-Rescue with Navigation Assistance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These search-and-rescue games are part of a research study conducted at Carnegie Mellon University.
                        The purpose of the research is to understand language complexities for navigation tasks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong> Procedures  </strong>
                        Your task is to perform search-and-rescue with a navigation assistant. Prior to the game, you will memorize
                        the names of various rooms from a building blueprint. Then, you will be tested on your memorization of the room names.
                        During the rescue, the navigation assistant will provide instructions that you MUST FOLLOW
                        in order to find and save all victims. Instructions will be displayed for each task. You may periodically during
                        and/or after the task be asked to respond to brief questions about your thoughts and feelings, including your
                        experience working with the navigation assistant.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> Participant Requirements   </strong>
                        Participation in this study is limited to individuals age 18 and older who are fluent English speakers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> Risks   </strong>
                        The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those
                        ordinarily encountered in daily life or during other online activities. These could include
                        boredom or fatigue, or may include mild negative emotions when being reminded of certain life
                        experiences. We expect these to be mild and will only last for a brief amount of time. There is
                        also a small risk of breach of confidentiality by associating your data with your name; however,
                        this risk is small since names are not stored in our data files.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> Benefits   </strong>
                        There may be no personal benefit from your participation in the study but the knowledge received may be of value to humanity.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        <strong> Compensation & Costs </strong>
                        The study is expected to last 30-40 minutes and you will be compensated $6.35 for your time.
                        There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        Your data and online consent form will be kept separate. Your consent response will be stored in a secure virtually on
                        Carnegie Mellon property and will not be disclosed to third parties. Sharing of data with other researchers will only
                        be done in such a manner that you will not be personally identified. By participating, you understand and agree that
                        the data and information gathered during this study may be used by Carnegie Mellon and published and/or disclosed
                        by Carnegie Mellon to others outside of Carnegie Mellon. However, your name and other direct personal identifiers
                        will not be mentioned in any such publication or dissemination of the research data and/or results by Carnegie Mellon.
